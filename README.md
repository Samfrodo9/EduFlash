### Description:

EduFlash is a web application that uses AI to help users learn more effectively. Users can paste text directly into the app, and EduFlash will analyze the text and automatically generate flashcards highlighting the key points. This saves time and effort compared to manually creating flashcards.

### Technologies:

*Frontend:* HTML, CSS and Javascript

*Backend:* Django



### Features:

*AI-powered text summarization:* Automatically generate flashcards from lengthy texts.
*Focus on factual information:* Prioritizes extracting factual information, minimizing risks associated with subjective interpretations.
*User-friendly interface:* Easy to use and navigate.
*Multiple learning modes:* Choose from different flashcard viewing options for optimal learning.
*Accessibility:* Web-based solution accessible on various devices and browsers.

### Target Audience:

1. Students preparing for exams or tests
2. Teachers seeking efficient study materials
3. Anyone interested in active learning and self-assessment
Benefits:

### Future Development:

* Integration with external data sources (e.g., educational articles, research papers)
* Mobile app development
* Advanced learning features like spaced repetition algorithms
* Text-to-speech functionality for accessibility
